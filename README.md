# Homelab

## Introduction

This repo contains all of my projects, configuration and documentation of my home lab.

This project was started to help me learn and display my skills in various programs / technologies that are used in the DevOps world.

The aim is to have a home lab running various different programs, such as python / bash scripts, using technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.


## Setup

My homelab currently consists of a single laptop on which I am running core services such as DHCP and DNS.

I am currently in the processes of redeploying my kubernetes files onto a VM. The idea is to migrate everything onto dedicated hardware (most likely Raspberry Pi's) at some stage in the near future.
